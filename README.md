My thoughts on lightweight, tightly focused, right-sized documentation

One of our industries huge failings has always been in the realm of dcooumentaiton.

I recall going to a new client, who informed me that we needed to follow their SDLC (Software Developement Life Cycle) process.

I asked to see it.  It was a set of 3, 3-inch binders stuffed full.

I politely declined.

Documentation needs to be small, light-weight, tightly focused to the subject at hand, and just the right
size to convey the needs.

The foundation document describes my thoughts and approach, and the Data Modeling doc is an example.

And that doc will really upset vendors who supply the tools that make you do it wrong so you are locked into their solution from day one.
